# 🚀 Development of Integrated MCU Dual Rotor Axial Flux Motor (IM-DRAFM)

---

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on designing and developing an **Integrated MCU Dual Rotor Axial Flux Motor (IM-DRAFM)**.  
Axial flux motors are gaining popularity in **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**, **Aerospace**, **Robotics**, and **Renewable Energy Systems** due to their:
- High torque & power density
- Compact size
- Advanced thermal management
- Better efficiency


## 🎯 Problem Statement & Objectives

### 🔴 Problems:
- Existing motors face poor torque-to-weight ratio.
- Space utilization issues in EV drivetrains.
- Costly & environmentally harmful materials.

### ✅ Objectives:
- Achieve high efficiency, torque & power density.
- Reduce & optimize form factor and flux topology.
- Integrate control systems into a single unit.
- Make the design scalable & affordable.


## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Use **Axial Flux Motor Technology** with **dual rotors**.
- Flux lines run parallel to the shaft for shorter magnetic path → higher torque.
- Modular design allows various stator-rotor combinations.
- Integrated MCU for advanced control and sensorless operation.
